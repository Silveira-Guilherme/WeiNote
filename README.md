🛠 Configure Database
WeiNote uses SQLite for local data storage. There's no extra setup needed, as SQLite is integrated into the project via the sqflite package.

Simply ensure that the database configuration is set up correctly in your code, and it will automatically manage your workout data.

Log Workouts: Add exercises, sets, weights, and reps to keep track of your sessions.
Track Progress: Use visual charts to analyze your progress over time.
Create Templates: Save custom workout routines to reuse in future sessions.
